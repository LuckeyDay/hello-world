# hello-world
just another repositiry

Dear reader!

Thanks a lot for opening me!! I thought I would never have been read by someone (except for naughty bots of course).  First, I was written by a student of technical university, nothing really especial about him (except for an awful sense of humor). It's pretty sad I have no sense in real world though. While I had been created, rain was going to begin. The phone had been charging and the next amazing day was about to show itself, no matter what weather was coming!
